# Link Tank

Link Tank: a UX-first approach to bookmark archiving.

## Why?

Because managing bookmarks in a web browser can be a real pain:

- Who even wants to go in there? It's a tedious exercise.
- Bookmarked pages are often no longer available.
- Different browsers don't sync to each other.
- We should not have to trust Google/Microsoft/etc with our data.
- It should be EASY to find and share previously saved links.
- Existing solutions are themselves tedious.

## Status

Just tinkering with different ideas, environment, workflow right now.
